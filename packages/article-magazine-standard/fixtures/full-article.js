However, the agreement was criticised by Unionists who refused to accept that its references to the principle of consent served to confirm the constitutional status of the Province. Thatcher, who had been in many respects the most Unionist of Conservative prime ministers, never much cared for this agreement and was to disavow it in her retirement."

I knew immediately that it was a bomb — perhaps two bombs, a large followed by a smaller device — but at this stage I did not know that the explosion had taken place inside the hotel. Glass from the windows of my sitting room was strewn across the carpet. But I thought that it might be a car bomb outside. (I only realised that the bomb had exploded above us when Penny, John Gummer’s wife, appeared a little later from upstairs, still in her night clothes.) The adjoining bathroom was more severely damaged, though the worst I would have suffered had I been in there were minor cuts. Those who had sought to kill me had placed the bomb in the wrong place.”"

As the Parliament drew towards its end, the Chancellor was able to offer the prospect of increased public spending in areas such as health and education, reductions in taxation and an easing of interest rates.
