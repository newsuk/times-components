Secondly, Thatcher’s own concerns about developments within the EU, and particularly about moves towards monetary union, put her increasingly at odds with many of her own ministers and MPs. Thirdly, her style of political management brought her into collision with two senior ministers, and after his resignation following illness in 1988 she no longer had her loyal and politically astute deputy Willie Whitelaw to rescue her from the consequences of high-handed rashness in personal dealings."

Thatcher had become increasingly concerned that Tebbit, whom she had made party chairman, was trying to promote himself not her, and she inserted her trusted ally, Lord Young, into Conservative Central Office to keep an eye on its chairman. The result was predictable.
