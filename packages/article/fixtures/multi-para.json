In Total Film magazine Sir Kenneth Branagh reveals a letter from Woody Allen, asking him to play Lee Simon in his 1998 film Celebrity. “When I wrote this part, I knew there was only one actor in the world who could play it: Alec Baldwin,” Allen wrote. “But he’s unavailable. So I considered for a while Mel Gibson, but decided in the end that you would be more appropriate. Lee Simon is a loser, but attractive to women.” Sounds like every character played by Allen himself."

You could stick your hands into the buckets of livers and it would warm you up.” What an offal experience."
