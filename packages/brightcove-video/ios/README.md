# iOS Setup

To install the Brightcove SDK, follow Brightcove's instructions found [here](https://github.com/brightcove/brightcove-player-sdk-ios#manual). We recommend using `v5.3.3`, however any recent version should be fine.

Navigate to `node_modules/@newsint/brightcove-video/ios/`, copying the two pairs of `.h` and `.m` files in to your project.

When you are presented with the dialogue, _do not_ copy the items. You may choose to create a group or not depending on your preferences.
