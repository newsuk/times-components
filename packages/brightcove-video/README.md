# Times Component - Brightcove Video

The integration with [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) has NOT been tested on our end.

# Native

## Getting started

* `yarn add @times-components/brightcove-video`
* `react-native link`

:warning: For native, the `policyKey` is required, see [Brightcove's Policy API](https://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/policy-api/getting-started/api-overview.html) for more details.

## iOS Install of the Brightcove SDK

### Install with Cocoapods

Add the 2 following lines to the top of your `ios/Podfile`

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git' # Add if you have other pods in your Podfile

```

and in your main Target, add :

```
pod 'Brightcove-Player-Core'
```

Then update your master repo to have the specs for Brightcove Player

```
