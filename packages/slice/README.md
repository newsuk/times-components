# Slice

Slices are templates. A slice lays out a set of components according to the
given template rules.

Visit the official
[storybook](http://components.thetimes.co.uk/?selectedKind=Primitives%2FSlice&selectedStory=Default%20template%20with%20one%20item&full=0&addons=1&stories=1&panelRight=0&addonPanel=storybooks%2Fstorybook-addon-knobs)
to see our available slice templates.

## Image Placeholder Rules

If an article has no image available (either as the lead image or generated from
the associated video), display a new generic Times / ST logo, NOT one that is
specific to the publication (The Times / The Sunday Times)

This should not apply in the following scenarios:

* Any homepage slices
* When the article page is missing it's lead image
