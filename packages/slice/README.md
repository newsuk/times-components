# Slice

Slices are templates for articles. A slice lays out a set of articles according
to template.

## Image Placeholder Rules

If an article has no image available (either as the lead image or generated from
the associated video), display a new generic Times/ ST logo, NOT one that is
specific to the publication (Times/ Sun Times)

This should apply in the following scenarios when an image is in a slice:

* author profile list page
* saved article list page
* related link tile image

but NOT in these scenarios:

* Search results list page - these don't display images anyway
* Any homepage slices
* This also does NOT apply to when an article page template is missing a lead
  image
