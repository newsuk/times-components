# CommentCard component
The `CommentCard` component is used to display a content from the journalist/author.

This takes in a series of props, as below, to display journalists details, the content, and the section heading and colour.

## Props
<Props of={CommentCard} />

## Code Example
```
<CommentCard
  image='https://www.thetimes.co.uk/d/img/profile/deborah-haynes.jpg'
  heading='Deborah Haynes'
  content='Now is Willis’s chance to show he’s got more to offer than Curry'
  href="/"
/>
```

## View Component
Please click the 'Canvas' tab for a better viewing experience, where you can update the props and review at the different breakpoints by clicking the preview icon and selecting from our list of pre-defined breakpoints (XS, SM, MD, LG and XL).
