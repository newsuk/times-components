# JournalistQuote component
The `JournalistQuote` component is used to display a quote from the journalist/author.

This takes in a series of props, as below, to display journalists details, the quote, and the section heading and colour.

## Props
<Props of={JournalistQuote} />

## Code Example
```
<JournalistQuote
  journalist={{
    name: 'Deborah Haynes',
    image: 'https://www.thetimes.co.uk/d/img/profile/deborah-haynes.jpg'
  }}
  quote='Now is Willis’s chance to show he’s got more to offer than Curry'
  heading=''
  sectionColour='#008347'
  textColour='#222222'
/>
```

## View Component
Please click the 'Canvas' tab for a better viewing experience, where you can update the props and review at the different breakpoints by clicking the preview icon and selecting from our list of pre-defined breakpoints (XS, SM, MD, LG and XL).
