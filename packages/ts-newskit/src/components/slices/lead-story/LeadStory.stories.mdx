This takes in a series of props, as below, to display the part of the slices.

## Props
<Props of={LeadStory} />

## Code Example
`<LeadStory data={{headline, color, readingTime, summary, bylines, subHeadline, caption, image, url}}/>`

Please click the 'Canvas' tab for a better viewing experience, where you can update the props and review at the different breakpoints by clicking the preview icon and selecting from our list of pre-defined breakpoints (XS, SM, MD, LG and XL).

export const HeaderStory = ({headline, color, readingTime, summary, bylines, subHeadline, caption, image, url}) => (
  <NewsKitProvider theme={TimesWebLightTheme}>
    <LeadStory {...{headline, color, readingTime, summary, bylines, subHeadline, caption, image, url}} />
  </NewsKitProvider>
);

<Story name="LeadStory"
