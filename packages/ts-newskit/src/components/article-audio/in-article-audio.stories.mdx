# InArticleAudio component
The `InArticleAudio` component displays your hierarchical position on the website.

This takes in a `data` prop, as below, to display the links in their order within the data object.

## Props
<Props of={InArticleAudio} />

## Code Example
```
<InArticleAudio
  src="https://ncu-newskit-docs.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/storybook-assets/audio_file_1.mp3"
  readyToPlayText='Listen to article'
  playingText='Playing'
  narrator='James Marriott'
  headline='Article headline'
  feedback={{
    requestFeedback: true,
    feedbackMessage: "Want to listen to more articles? Give your feedback below or email",
    thankyouMessage: "Thank you for your feedback. We're always trying to give you the best possible experience – your feedback helps us do this."
  }}
/>
```

An example of the `data` structure can be found in the 'Controls' section on the 'Canvas' tab, where you can customise the data being fed to the InArticleAudio component.
