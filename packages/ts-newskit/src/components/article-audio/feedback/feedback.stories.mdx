# Feedback component
The `Feedback` component displays feedback section of radio player.

This takes in a series of props, as below, to display feedbackMessage and message.


## Props
<Props of={Feedback} />

## Code Example
`<Feedback 
       feedbackMessage: "Thank you for your feedback.",
       message: "Want to listen to more articles? Give your feedback below or email",
 />`

An example of the `data` structure can be found in the 'Controls' section on the 'Canvas' tab, where you can customise the data being fed to the Feedback component.
