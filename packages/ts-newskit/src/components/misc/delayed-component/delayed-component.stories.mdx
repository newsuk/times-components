# DelayedComponent component
The `DelayedComponent` component is a helper component used to delay the mount or dismount of the children passed to the component. 

This component takes in three props: `initialState`, `delay` and `children`. 
initialState - This used to set the initial component state, if it is meant to be displayed initially and removed after x amount of time intialState would be true. and Vice versa.
delay - This is the time in milliseconds it takes for the component to mount or unmount. 

Given the nature of this component you may need to play around with the controls so that you can see what it's doing. 



## Props
