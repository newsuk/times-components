# Breadcrumb component
The `Breadcrumb` component displays your hierarchical position on the website.

This takes in a `data` prop, as below, to display the links in their order within the data object.

## Props
<Props of={Breadcrumb} />

## Code Example
`<Breadcrumb data={data} />`

An example of the `data` structure can be found in the 'Controls' section on the 'Canvas' tab, where you can customise the data being fed to the Breadcrumb component.

## View Component
Please click the 'Canvas' tab for a better viewing experience, where you can update the props and review at the different breakpoints by clicking the preview icon and selecting from our list of pre-defined breakpoints (XS, SM, MD, LG and XL).

export const BreadcrumbStory = ({ data }) => (
  <TCThemeProvider>
    <Breadcrumb {...{ data }} />
  </TCThemeProvider>
);

<Story name="Breadcrumb" args={{ data: breadcrumbItems }}>
  {BreadcrumbStory.bind({})}
</Story>
