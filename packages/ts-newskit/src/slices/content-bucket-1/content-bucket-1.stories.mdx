# ContentBucket1 component
The `ContentBucket1` component is used to display the main story, supplementary articles and comment quotes.
It is comprised of the `leadArticle`, `SliceHeader`, `ArticleListItem`, and `CommentCard` slice components.

This takes in a series of props, as below, to display the part of the slices.

## Props
<Props of={ContentBucket1} />

## Code Example
`<ContentBucket1 {...{ section, leadArticle, comments, articles }} />`
