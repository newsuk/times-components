# LeadStory1 component
The `LeadStory1` component is used to display the main story, supplementary articles and comment quotes.

This takes in a series of props, as below, to display the part of the slices.

## Props
<Props of={LeadStory1} />

## Code Example
`<LeadStory1 {...{ leadArticle, comments, largeArticles, smallArticles }} />`
