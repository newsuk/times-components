# Sticky

Attach children to viewport on scroll (web only)

This also supports sticking relative to a specified container using the provided
`StickyProvider` component, which renders a chosen element (defaults to a `div`)
to calculate the required offset. This can be useful if you wish to stick the
component below another fixed element.
