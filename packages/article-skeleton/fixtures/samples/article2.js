She was easily visible against the sand mound, and then suddenly the smears of black through bronze to cream that give these dogs their name melted into the backdrop of winter leaves, shadows and bark."

No cement is laid, no foundation poles driven into the earth. Yet, stripped of any frivolousness, it still provided every luxury we wanted. Our nine-strong group had the six en suite double tents to ourselves, with flush loos and bucket showers from river water warmed over a fire. The only hint of modernity was the discreet solar panels powering our evening lights."
