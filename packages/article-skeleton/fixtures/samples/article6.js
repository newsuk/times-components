Seconds later, a middle-aged man stands alone, groping for an unfathomable childhood memory. Spool back to the 1980s, and the woes piling on the motherless family of Boy (Samuel Blenkin, heart-piercing). Something dark has been disturbed in the earth, warns his odd new friend Lettie (Marli Siu), scion of an ancient neighbouring female farming clan. This sounds complicated, but Joel Horwood’s"

Agatha Meehan (sharing the role with Lucy Sherman) is a determined Dorothy, and her pigtails suggest Greta Thunberg. Simon Higlett’s design includes a spectacular twister (video effects by Simon Wainwright) as beige Kansas gives way to the colourful land of the Munchkins. Scarecrow (Eleanor Sutton), Tin Man (Sam Harrison) and Lion (Marcus Ayton) make a lovable trio; they are in danger of being upstaged by the puppeteer Ailsa Dalling’s delicate handling of Toto, Dorothy’s dog. Polly Lister is magnificently evil as the Wicked Witch: some of the younger children snuggled up to their parents whenever she appeared. James Brining’s production proves L Frank Baum’s story still appeals to all ages. "

It’s not perfect. The playwright Jack Thorne’s interpolations — he explains the miser’s misanthropy by giving him an abusive, debt-ridden father — don’t seem necessary and can’t match the original’s voracious verbal inventiveness. Yet Paterson Joseph commands the stage as an energetic and very sweaty Scrooge, Steven Miller excels as a stammering, palpably worthy Bob Cratchit, and Andrew Langtree, dragging a truckload of self-forged chains, makes a chilling Father/Marley. Adults can reflect on the universality of the story and consider whether for us, as for Scrooge, it’s not too late to change our ways. Children get satsumas, melodious campanology and a Tiny Tim to die for (Lara Mehmet). It adds up to a magical treat. "

The Poldark star John Hopkins anchors the action as Scrooge, as he rightly should, with strength and charisma, sneering scornfully at the “wavy language” used by BSL-deploying Bob Cratchit (Stephen Collins). On press night, an increasingly reluctant young member of the audience was dragooned into playing Tiny Tim; “Bah humbug” she might have said as she was pulled on stage. Around Scrooge bubbles much original music (Gwyneth Herbert), inventive ensemble work and wacky wigs. It’s a treat to watch the monochrome costumes begin to burst with colour as Scrooge treads his path towards human connection. "

At one of London’s most atmospherically dilapidated Victorian venues, Piers Torday’s adaptation takes bold liberties. Scrooge is not Ebenezer, who died young, but his sister Fan (Sally Dexter), widowed after an unhappy marriage to Jacob Marley. The Ghost of Christmas Future transports Scrooge to the payday lender MarleyScrooge.com, where a scion struggles to juggle family and career. Scrooge’s awakening owes as much to left-wing feminism as to philanthropy. At times, this occasionally scrappy adaptation strains too hard for contemporary kudos, but imaginative ghosts and puppetry impress, and its warm humour lands. "

There’s no dad, only a harassed, often absent foster mum, played by Nia Gwynne, who — as JM Barrie originally intended — doubles as the dastardly Captain Hook. The graffiti-sprayed set transforms a concrete courtyard into Neverland’s lagoon, a pirate galleon and the subterranean home of the “Lost Ones” (girls as well as boys here) with terrific ingenuity. Lawrence Walker makes an intriguingly dim Peter Pan, yet this is Wendy’s story. In an effective reversal, Tsang, who has had to play mother to her two brothers, must learn to be a child. "

The set evokes Klassen’s instantly recognisable visual style, Cath Whitefield’s Wolf is suitably hapless, and Sam Buttery’s burbling Duck entertains. But the script embellishes the tale of their strange symbiosis so much that it becomes confusing. The production is watchable, but less visceral than the original."

The real fun occurs when we’re in the presence of Hackney stalwarts Clive Rowe (as Sarah the Cook) and Tony Whittle (a lovely Tommy Cooperesque turn as the Alderman). I’m not sure I’ve seen a performance on a London stage as deliciously lubricious as Rowe’s since Douglas Hodge romped through La Cage aux folles. The plot loses its way at times, which tested the patience of my eight-year-old daughter, but this is a heartwarming affair from a team who know which buttons to press. See feature, in this section.

                      "“You know nothing of the horrors that await you in the night,” glooms a thistly Scottish housekeeper when the American Otis family move into Canterville Chase, a gothic pile with a resident ghost. Many claps of thunder ensue, as do attempts at haunting by the 400-year-old Sir Simon Canterville, who ran his wife through with a cooking skewer. But the brunch-obsessed, matter-of-fact Otis clan take little notice. Couldn’t they be a teensy bit more disturbed by the blood-soaked carpet? And why aren’t they dying to solve the riddle of Canterville Chase? Anthony Weigh’s adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s gothic spoof is too leisurely to get your child’s hair standing on end, and Justin Audibert’s production betrays its own anxieties about how much it should spook the over-7s. But this is a decent theatrical intro to the “man with a large hat and an even larger wit”. "
