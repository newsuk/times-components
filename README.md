# The Times Component Library

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/newsuk/times-components/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/newsuk/times-components)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/newsuk/times-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/newsuk/times-components)

### Purpose

Home of The Times' `react`/`react native` components, using
[react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to share across
platforms

### Dev Environment

We require MacOS with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >=8 with npm v5),
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (latest) and
[watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) installed. Native development
requires [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode),
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and
[JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html).

You can try without these requirements, but you'd be on your own.

## Getting Started

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Install [fontforge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/): `brew install
   fontforge` (See [Fonts section](#fonts))
3. Components can be seen running in a storybook:

* web storybook
  1. `yarn storybook`
  2. go to http://localhost:9001
* native storybook
  1. `yarn storybook-native` and leave it running
  2. `yarn ios` to start the iOS app
  3. To start the Android app:
     * [Start a virtual device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html)
     * `yarn android`
     * If you get build errors, check your JDK version with `javac -version`,
       which should print `javac 1.8.XXXX`. Earlier or later versions may not
       work.
  4. go to http://localhost:7007

### Fonts ⚠️

In order to view the storybook on native, you'll need to fix broken fonts. This
fix is done automatically when running storybook (both web and native), but
requires that [fontforge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) is installed,
otherwise the fix won't be applied and you'll get the classic red error screen
when trying to use a broken font.
