# The Times Component Library

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/newsuk/times-components/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/newsuk/times-components?branch=master)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/newsuk/times-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/newsuk/times-components)

### Purpose

Home of The Times' `react`/`react native` components, using
[react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to share across
platforms

### Dev Environment

We require MacOS with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >=8 with npm v5),
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (latest) and
[watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) installed. Native development
requires [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode),
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and
[JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html).

You can try without these requirements, but you'd be on your own.

## Viewing Our Components

If you use Expo you are able to scan the QR code below

<img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nu-tools-expo/MasterExpo.png">

This has been made possible using [Fructose](https://github.com/newsuk/fructose)

## Getting Started

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies with a `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` envar set for
   linting. _This is simply an example GraphQL endpoint, and you will need to
   obtain a valid API endpoint in order to successfully work with this
   repository._

```
GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4000/graphql" yarn
```

2. Install [fontforge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/): `brew install fontforge` (See [Fonts section](#fonts))
3. Components can be seen running in a storybook:

- web storybook
  1. `yarn storybook`
  2. go to http://localhost:9001
- native storybook
  1. `yarn storybook-native` and leave it running
  2. `yarn ios` to start the iOS app
  3. To start the Android app:
     - [Start a virtual device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html)
     - Check Android SDK path is exported to $ANDROID_HOME. In Mac, android sdk
       is installed to ~/Library/Android/sdk by default. `export ANDROID_HOME="/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Android/sdk"`
     - `yarn android`
     - If you get build errors, check your JDK version with `javac -version`,
       which should print `javac 1.8.XXXX`. Earlier or later versions may not
       work.
  4. go to http://localhost:7007

## Native App Dev Server

In order to run development servers for native applications, start haul dev
server via:

`yarn android:app` or `yarn ios:app`

## Haul

We use Haul in lieu of the standard `react-native` CLI so that we can generate
native Storybook bundles using Webpack, which we configure to honour our
monorepo packages' respective `dev` entry points; this allows one to update a
package's source code and preview the changes without having to manually
re-transpile. Haul also automatically generates debuggable source maps.

### Fonts ⚠️

In order to view the storybook on native, you'll need to fix broken fonts. This
fix is done automatically when running storybook (both web and native), but
requires that [fontforge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) is installed,
otherwise the fix won't be applied and you'll get the classic red error screen
when trying to use a broken font.

### Schema

See [utils package](packages/utils/README.md) on how to update the schema

## Debugging

The components in this project can be debugged through your browser's developer
tools. These steps assume the use of Chrome DevTools.

To debug our web Storybook:

1. `yarn storybook`
2. navigate to http://localhost:9001
3. open DevTools
4. Click _Sources_
5. In the _Network_ tab under the leftmost pane, expand _top_ =>
   _storybook-preview-iframe_ => _webpack://_ => _._ => _packages_

Any of these source files can be debugged directly.

To debug our native Storybook:

1. `yarn storybook-native` and leave it running
2. `yarn android:logs` or `yarn ios:logs` (this will build storybook app and output logs)
2a. Or you could just run `yarn android` or `yarn ios` to just build the apps
3. open the developer menu on your device (Cmd + M on Android, Cmd + D on iOS)
   and tap _Debug JS Remotely_
4. navigate to http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui if it hasn't opened
   automatically
5. open DevTools
6. click _Sources_
7. expand _debuggerWorker.js_ => _webpack://_ => _._ => _packages_
